On calculation of PCA and GEI and economical preferences

On PCA (what are uncirteinties for components and projections?):

"The PCA is intrinsically a linear procedure, so it is non-robust, in the sense of Huber (2003), to various distributional assumptions violations. 
In particular, if the distribution of x exhibits high skewness and/or kurtosis, the weights and eigenvalues in PCA will have higher variances, and converge to their asymptotic distributions slower
(Davis 1977).".
