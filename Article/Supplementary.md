## Critics


### Gender Equality Index robustness and validity

As a point of strong criticism, the article @FH lacks any discussion on the gender equality indexes involved in the analysis. No citations were provided on any related work that may shield the light on the validation and performance of the indexes under consideration. Besides, no discussion on their relation to the economic preferences were provided.

A closer look at them rises a series of questions about general validity of this indexes for the study and validity of the indexes per se.

As xxx indicated in her study the GGG index became more as matter of prestige rather then a robust proxy for the progress in gender development.



Even though some of these indexes are commonly accepted in economics and politics as a measure of gender equality, the status and performance from a scientific perspective is a subject of in-depth investigation that goes beyond this reproduction analysis.

In this section, we provide a brief description and investigation of the indexes that were used in the original article, together with related sources of data and methodology.

Four different measures were used to build gender equality index, which was defined as the first Principle Component of them. We show the structure of the index as a diagram (figure).

As one can see several indexes contain the repetitive components, so most likely after PCA application they are going to be filtrated.

- How PCA correlates with other components?

- What are the first and the second component?

Is the resulting Gender Equality Index just the same as work-force ratio because of PCA filtration of the result?

H: overall index is strongly correlated with the indicators that are repeated in the calculation of the overall index.

A brief look at the composition of the data and sources provokes several questions regarding the validity of the indicators to be used as a proxy for gender equality in the study.

One of the integral components of the WEF index is the ratio of the average income for man and women. Surprisingly, an arbitrary maximum value of the income in 40 000 $ was set in index calculation. For example, ***, rated as the last country in the list had the 111 and 222 dollars outcome with an index ratio 111/222, while the first county in the rating was ***, with 333 and 444 average salaries rates for man and women, respectively. However, the calculated rate is 333/500. As the arbitrary maximum income was set. 

Another indicator "fairness of the salary" is not a subjective assessment from the World Economic Forum from the executives.

Information summary on time since women suffrage: the table does not contain links on the related sources.

- What about cross-calibration for personal interview vs telephone interview? Was it verified that the results for economic preferences are the same in both cases? Where? I would expect it different. There should be some info in literature about that (XiaoChi Zhang, 2017).

### Differences in effect size

The original article presents the results in a normalized way: Taking the minimum difference as 0 and the maximum as 1, any reference to the size of the effect is lost. The question arising from it is the following: Is the detected gender difference only statistically significant, or has it also a "visible" effect in the real world? 

To answer this question, one must keep in mind that:

1. The data provided by the authors are already merged together into a single bit of information for each preference. Any preference (except from trust) had 2 or 3 questions that were later merged by the authors into a single answer, and then standardized. This means that any reference to the reality is lost, and one can't answer the question "how different are men and women regarding patience?", because the scale is an abstract one and can't provide any insight but a relative one.

2. Even worse happens when looking at the PCA of the preferences, when they are then all mixed together.

The point here is that when we look at the data, it seems that it is heteroskedastic, because with increasing GDP the standard deviation increases (see our studies). Then having a standardization on the whole dataset might be not the best idea to measure the gender differences --> Not sure that this is true, must check

*I need to write better this part*

- Not raw data available (and in general not all data available)
